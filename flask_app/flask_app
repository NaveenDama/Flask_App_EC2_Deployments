Remove all lines below including this line when copying the config:

listen 80 means it will serve http requests only. check your web address to be http://<public-ip of EC2> not https://

server_name 34.229.41.140; -> here replace the IP with your EC2 public IP address.

location / -> Every request starting with "/" will be forwarded to flaskapp.sock present in "/home/ubuntu/flask_app/" folder
